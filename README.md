# Project 1: Movie Recommender
For this project, you will implement a simple movie recommender that makes recommendations 
to a given user based on what "similar" users liked in the past. 
Such approach is called collaborative filtering. Different algorithms can be used to compute similarity 
between a pair of users given their movie ratings. 
We will use Pearson correlation. You will store movie ratings data in a custom data structure 
built using linked lists. The description of the project is on the course website on Canvas (under Assignments/Project 1).
